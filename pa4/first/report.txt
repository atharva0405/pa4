For this project, I used two arrays of linked lists, one for the non-prefetched array of linked lists, and one for the prefetched array of linked lists. Since the prefetcher accesses the memory around the block around the first one it goes to (uses spacial locality), it increases the number of reads and hits while the misses are decreased. The reason for this is that the A+X block is loaded onto the cache and it increases the chances of a hit since it is likely that around one hit, there will likely be the same address accessed again. If there isn't a hit, the reads will increase for the A block as well as the A+X block, hence the increased amount of reads.
